Question: Why was the Scottish Terrier chosen as Carnegie Mellon University's mascot? 
Context: Fun Fact about Scottish terrier

The Scottish terrier breed is known for its keen, alert and intelligent expression. Its temperament is described as determined and thoughtful while its physical aspects exemplify strength, power and agility in a small package. Many of these traits are also apparent throughout the university, making the Scottish terrier a natural choice for Carnegie Mellon's mascot.

Official Mascot? More than a century after Carnegie Mellon University opened its doors, an official mascot finally made its mark. Although students have dressed as a Scottish terrier — typically referred to as Scotty — for 50 years, it wasn't until 2007 that Carnegie Mellon officially welcomed the Scottish terrier as the university's first mascot.

About Scotty

The Scottish terrier has long been a familiar figure around Carnegie Mellon's campus. For years students have suited up in an unofficial Scottish terrier costume to excite the fans at athletic events. But the relationship between the Scottish terrier breed and Carnegie Mellon far precedes anybody doing somersaults in a dog costume. Andrew Carnegie, founder of the university, kept a Scottish terrier as his pet.

Carnegie Mellon's official mascot debuted at the Nov. 10, 2007 home football game. The graphic features a profile of a distinguished, bold Scottish terrier sporting a plaid scarf around his neck. The dog is contained in a shield, representing Carnegie Mellon's Scottish heritage.

The Task Force then partnered with a mascot costume company to design our Scottish terrier in the winter of 2007. The official Scotty costume was unveiled at the 2008 Spring Carnival. 
Answer: The Scottish terrier was chosen as Carnegie Mellon University's mascot because of its keen, alert, and intelligent expression, as well as its strength, power, and agility in a small package, which are all qualities that are also apparent throughout the university.

Question: What was the original name of the Carnegie Institute of Technology? 
Context: Scotland, in 1835. Carnegie came to the United States in 1848 and founded Carnegie Technical Schools in Pittsburgh in 1900.

Carnegie Tech – Early Years

Soon faced with the demand for baccalaureate programs, Carnegie Technical Schools began offering bachelor's degrees through its College of Engineering and College of Fine Arts, becoming the Carnegie Institute of Technology, or "Carnegie Tech." During the first half of the 20th century, with support from Andrew Carnegie and other funders, Carnegie Tech laid the foundation for a school on the cutting edge. Some key developments were:

At one point the richest man in the world, Carnegie believed that "to die rich is to die disgraced." He turned his attention to writing, social activism and philanthropy, determined to establish educational opportunities for the general public where few existed. In 1900, he donated $1 million for the creation of a technical institute for the city of Pittsburgh, envisioning a school where working-class men and women of Pittsburgh could learn practical skills, trades and crafts that would enhance

Question: What kind of music does The Kiltie Band perform? 
Context: The Kiltie Band

The Kiltie Band began in 1908 with a group of just seven students dedicated to supporting Carnegie Tech football, and today's Kiltie Band continues a tradition of excellence originated over a century ago. The Band took the field for its first official performance on November 25th, 1922, on what would have been Andrew Carnegie's 87th birthday.

The Kiltie Marching Band consists of musicians and colorguard and plays at all Carnegie Mellon home football games. There is a new show every week with music ranging from traditional marches and oldies to current pop tunes and jazz standards.

After football season, the Kiltie Concert Band plays a holiday concert and two spring concerts, including a performance at Carnegie Mellon’s Spring Carnival. Additionally, a part of the band gets together and acts as a pep band for the basketball teams.

Q: Are there auditions? A: No, any member of the campus community with music experience is able to join the Kiltie Band!

Question: What is unique about the graphic mascot's appearance? 
Context: Official Mascot? More than a century after Carnegie Mellon University opened its doors, an official mascot finally made its mark. Although students have dressed as a Scottish terrier — typically referred to as Scotty — for 50 years, it wasn't until 2007 that Carnegie Mellon officially welcomed the Scottish terrier as the university's first mascot.

Carnegie Mellon's official mascot debuted at the Nov. 10, 2007 home football game. The graphic features a profile of a distinguished, bold Scottish terrier sporting a plaid scarf around his neck. The dog is contained in a shield, representing Carnegie Mellon's Scottish heritage.

The Task Force then partnered with a mascot costume company to design our Scottish terrier in the winter of 2007. The official Scotty costume was unveiled at the 2008 Spring Carnival.

In the spring, the Task Force partnered with SME Branding — a firm with more than 17 years of experience creating mascots for professional sports teams and universities — to develop the graphics for the mascot. During October, students and alumni reviewed potential mascot images in focus groups.

The Scottish terrier mascot performer sports Carnegie tartan attire, while the graphic mascot is wearing a plaid scarf around its neck. 
Answer: The graphic mascot's appearance is unique because it features a distinctive plaid scarf around its neck, which represents Carnegie Mellon's Scottish heritage.

Question: Where can you find items featuring the official tartan pattern? 
Context: You'll know it's a tartan if... • "It's a check or pattern in a variety of colours in woven fabric in which bands of colour are repeated in equal proportion in warp (running lengthwise) and weft (running across)." • "Each stripe of the warp crosses every stripe of the weft, so when vertical and horizontal stripes of the same color cross, the result is solid color at the point of intersection." • "The arrangement of colored threads is the same in the warp as in the weft."

More specifically, these patterns include: (1) Pattern 112: Entrance transition, (2) Pattern 159: Light on two sides of every room pattern, (3) Pattern 115: Courtyards which live and (4) Pattern 119: Arcades. These patterns were selected because Alexander et al (1977) marked these patterns as well- tested design solutions that have been empirically observed as the consistent design preference for occupants living in the studied spaces. Verified patterns are chosen to be tested first to gain

What is a Tartan?

So what's the difference between tartan and plaid? 
Answer: A tartan is a specific type of pattern that features alternating bands of coloured threads in a repeating sequence. It is characterized by the equal proportion of bands of colour in both the warp and weft directions. Plaid, on the other hand, is a broader term that refers to any pattern featuring stripes of contrasting colours. While tartans typically feature a specific repeating sequence of colours, plaids may have a more random or irregular pattern of stripes.
