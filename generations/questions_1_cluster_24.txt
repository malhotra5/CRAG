||| To answer your question, I will provide a concise response based on the information provided in the book.

According to the MSAII program handbook, students are required to complete a capstone project as part of their degree requirements. The capstone project involves working on a development project as a team and provides students with hands-on experience in software development, as well as an opportunity to work on a large software application.

The requirements for the capstone project include:

* Completing a capstone project (36 units)
* Completing a capstone planning seminar (6 units)
* Working on a development project as a team
* Gaining hands-on experience in software development
* Having an opportunity to work on a large software application

In addition, students are expected to complete their degree requirements within five consecutive semesters and must register for their capstone project and planning seminar in the semester prior to taking the cap
|||  The Andrew Project at CMU was a research initiative launched in 1982 in collaboration with IBM to create a high-speed computer network and GUI-based computing environment to provide equal access to educational resources for students, faculty, and staff. The project aimed to wire the entire campus with networked PCs or workstations, making CMU the most-wired campus in the world. The project also laid the groundwork for the development of Java, a programming language that enabled cross-platform compatibility. The Andrew Project's goals were to promote interoperability between computers and ensure equal access to educational resources for all, regardless of the type of device used.</s>
||| Sure, I'd be happy to help! Based on the provided context, here is a concise summary of the paper "3D Semantic Segmentation in the Wild: Learning Generalized Models for Adverse-Condition Point Clouds":

The paper introduces SemanticSTF, a new dataset for 3D semantic segmentation in the wild, which includes point cloud data captured under various adverse conditions such as rain, fog, and dust. The authors propose a novel framework called PointDR, which utilizes data augmentation techniques to improve the robustness of 3D semantic segmentation models to adverse conditions. They evaluate PointDR on both SemanticKITTI and SemanticSTF datasets and show that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness to adverse conditions.

The authors also conduct a comprehensive study on the effects of data augmentation techniques on 3
|||  The Scottish Terrier was chosen as Carnegie Mellon University's mascot due to its Scottish heritage and the breed's characteristics, which match the university's values of strength, power, and agility. The breed is also known for its intelligent and thoughtful temperament, which aligns with the university's academic excellence. The decision to officially adopt the Scottish Terrier as the university's mascot was made after a vote by students, faculty, staff, and alumni, with the name "Scotty" being chosen for both the costumed mascot and the live university dog.</s>
|||  Sure, I'd be happy to help! According to the text, the original name of the Carnegie Institute of Technology was Carnegie Technical Schools, which was founded in 1900 by Andrew Carnegie. Twelve years later, in 1912, it became known as the Carnegie Institute of Technology. In 1967, the school merged with the Mellon Institute and became Carnegie Mellon University. Therefore, the answer to the question is: Carnegie Technical Schools.</s>

||| The temperament of the Scottish Terrier breed reflects well on Carnegie Mellon University's ethos in several ways. Firstly, the breed is known for its intelligence, determination, and thoughtfulness, which are all qualities that are valued in the university's academic community. The Scottish Terrier's keen expression and alert nature also align with the university's commitment to excellence and its emphasis on intellectual curiosity.

Furthermore, the breed's loyal and affectionate nature aligns with the university's values of community and collaboration. The fact that Andrew Carnegie, the university's founder, kept a Scottish Terrier as his pet suggests that the breed holds a special place in the university's history and culture.

Overall, the Scottish Terrier's temperament reflects well on Carnegie Mellon University's ethos by embodying
|||  The Andrew Project, launched in 1982 in collaboration with IBM, enabled Carnegie Mellon University to become the best-wired campus in the world. The project provided networked PCs or workstations for 7,000 students, faculty members, and employees, and established a high-speed computer network and GUI-based computing environment. This enabled the university to double its sponsored research in computer science from $7.2 million to $15.3 million between 1982 and 1985. The university also became home to the Software Engineering Institute, which studied computer security and developed best practices in operating system design. As a result of these advancements, Carnegie Mellon became a leader in computer science and remains one of the most-wired campuses in the world.</s>
|||  Based on the provided context, the following are the courses offered in the first year of the MLT program:

1. 10-605 Machine Learning with Large Data Sets (12 units) (offered in the first spring semester)
2. 11-611 Natural Language Processing (12 units) (offered in the second fall semester)
3. 11-785 Deep Learning (12 units) (offered in the second spring semester)
4. One additional 12-unit AI, ML, or NLP course of the student's choice (with approval of the Program Director)

It's important to note that these courses are subject to change and the student should check with the program director for the most up-to-date information.</s>
|||  The significance of the first U.S. drama degree awarded at Carnegie Tech in 1914 was that it marked a major milestone in the development of higher education in the United States. Prior to this, drama programs were primarily offered at conservatories or schools of drama, which were often associated with professional theaters. The establishment of a drama program at Carnegie Tech, which was a technical school at the time, signified a shift towards a more academic approach to theater training, with a focus on the technical and artistic aspects of the craft. This development helped to establish drama as a legitimate field of study in higher education, and paved the way for the growth of drama programs across the country. Additionally, the fact that Carnegie Tech offered a graduate degree in drama in 1919 further solidified the institution's reputation as a leader in the field of theater arts.</s>
